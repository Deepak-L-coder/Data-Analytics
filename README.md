# Project 1 : Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Introduction

This project is centered around customer segmentation, an essential strategy in modern marketing and business analytics. The goal is to analyze customer data to identify distinct segments within the customer base, enabling targeted marketing strategies, improved customer satisfaction, and optimized resource allocation.

### Objectives:
- **Identify key customer segments** based on purchasing behavior and demographic information.
- **Analyze the characteristics** of each segment to understand their preferences and needs.
- **Provide actionable insights** for targeted marketing and business decisions.

## Data Insights

### Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains various features related to customer demographics, purchase history, and response to marketing campaigns. Key columns include:
- **Income**: The annual income of customers.
- **Kidhome**: The number of children in the household.
- **Teenhome**: The number of teenagers in the household.
- **Recency**: Days since the last purchase.
- **MntWines**: Amount spent on wine products.
- **MntFruits**: Amount spent on fruit products.
- **MntMeatProducts**: Amount spent on meat products.
- **MntFishProducts**: Amount spent on fish products.
- **MntSweetProducts**: Amount spent on sweet products.
- **MntGoldProds**: Amount spent on gold products.
- **AcceptedCmpOverall**: Number of accepted marketing campaigns.

### Analysis and Insights:
- **Customer Segments**: The analysis likely includes clustering techniques to identify distinct customer segments. Each segment can be characterized by unique spending behaviors and demographic factors.
- **Spending Patterns**: By analyzing the total spending (`MntTotal`) and spending on regular products (`MntRegularProds`), we can identify high-value customers who contribute significantly to revenue.
- **Campaign Effectiveness**: The `AcceptedCmpOverall` feature allows for the evaluation of the effectiveness of past marketing campaigns, helping in the design of future strategies.

## Conclusion

This project offers a comprehensive look at customer segmentation, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. These insights can drive targeted marketing efforts, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately lead to increased business success.

- Key statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation were derived for total sales amounts, helping to understand the central tendency and variability in the sales data.

### 3. Product Performance
- **Total Sales by Product Category:** 
  - A bar chart visualized total sales by product category, revealing the top-performing categories.
- **Inventory Turnover:** 
  - The analysis identified product categories with the lowest inventory turnover, highlighting areas for potential improvement in sales strategies.

### 4. Gender and Age Analysis
- A line plot examined average purchases by gender, offering a demographic perspective on customer behavior.

### 5. Correlation Analysis
- A correlation matrix was plotted to assess relationships between variables such as age, quantity purchased, and total amount spent.

### 6. Price Sensitivity
- The relationship between price per unit and total sales was analyzed, providing insights into how pricing strategies might impact sales volumes.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python:** For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
